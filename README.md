# Road map

1. configs - folder with different congfig files, used during training
2. plots - folder with notebook that contains main plots that used in presentation
3. additional_files - folder with files that I used during preparation datasets, when I checked models correctness
4. detection - folder contains simple example of training files to YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 (detection)
5. segmentation - folder contains simple example of training files to YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 (segmnetation) and also files what were used to prepare datasets and show results
